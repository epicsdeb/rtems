/*
 *  _Heap_Resize_block
 *
 *  DESCRIPTION:
 *
 *  This routine tries to resize in place the block that is pointed to by the
 *  'starting_address' to the new 'size'.
 *
 *  Input parameters:
 *    the_heap         - pointer to heap header
 *    starting_address - starting address of the memory block
 *    size             - new size
 *
 *  Output parameters:
 *    'old_mem_size'   - the size of the user memory area of the block before
 *                       resizing.
 *    'avail_mem_size' - the size of the user memory area of the free block
 *                       that has been enlarged or created due to resizing,
 *                       0 if none.
 *    Returns
 *      HEAP_RESIZE_SUCCESSFUL  - if success
 *      HEAP_RESIZE_UNSATISFIED - if the block can't be resized in place
 *      HEAP_RESIZE_FATAL_ERROR - if failure
