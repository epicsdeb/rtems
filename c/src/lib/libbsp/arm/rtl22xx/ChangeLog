	PR 1380/bsps
	* include/bsp.h: Switch to English comments.

2008-12-08	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* bsp_specs: Backport from CVS-HEAD.

2008-05-14	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am: Rework to avoid .rel files.

2008-05-12	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Refactored and renamed initialization routines to
	rtems_initialize_data_structures, rtems_initialize_before_drivers,
	rtems_initialize_device_drivers, and
	rtems_initialize_start_multitasking. This opened the sequence up so
	that bootcard() could provide a more robust and flexible framework
	which is easier to explain and understand. This also lays the
	groundwork for sharing the division of available memory between the
	RTEMS workspace and heap and the C library initialization across all
	BSPs.

2008-03-03	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/linkcmds: Add wildcard to gcc_except_table section so
	programs compiled with gcc 4.3.x can link.

2007-12-11	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h, startup/bspstart.c: Eliminate copies of the
	Configuration Table. Use the RTEMS provided accessor macros to obtain
	configuration fields.

2007-12-04	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h, startup/bspstart.c: Move interrupt_stack_size field
	from CPU Table to Configuration Table. Eliminate CPU Table from all
	ports. Delete references to CPU Table in all forms.

2007-12-03	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, include/bsp.h, startup/bspstart.c: Moved most of the
	remaining CPU Table fields to the Configuration Table. This included
	pretasking_hook, predriver_hook, postdriver_hook, idle_task,
	do_zero_of_workspace, extra_mpci_receive_server_stack,
	stack_allocate_hook, and stack_free_hook. As a side-effect of this
	effort some multiprocessing code was made conditional and some style
	clean up occurred.

2007-11-03      Ray Xu <rayx.cn@gmail.com>

        * start/start.S, startup/bspclean.c: Add veneer between ARM and 
        Thumb instructions.  also moved bss init after CPSR/stack init in
	start.S

2007-09-12	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	PR 1257/bsps
	* startup/bspstart.c: Code outside of cpukit should use the public
	API for rtems_interrupt_disable/rtems_interrupt_enable. By bypassing
	the public API and directly accessing _CPU_ISR_Disable and
	_CPU_ISR_Enable, they were bypassing the compiler memory barrier
	directive which could lead to problems. This patch also changes the
	type of the variable passed into these routines and addresses minor
	style issues.

2007-05-28	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Eliminate maximum_drivers configuration parameter
2007-08-28	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* README: Clean up.

2007-06-22	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* network/network.c: Remove cs8900_get_mac_addr which conflicted with
	one in libchip AND contained a hard-coded MAC address.

2007-06-13	Ray Xu <rayx@gmail.com>

	* startup/linkcmds: Shrink the aligment requirements.

2007-05-28	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Eliminate maximum_drivers configuration parameter
	since it was used to configure a no longer used feature. Device names
	are now part of the filesystem not in a table.

2007-05-15	Ray Xu <rayx@gmail.com>

	* Makefile.am: Add abort.rel since it is now in the BSP shared source,
	not in score/cpu.

2007-05-09	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspclean.c: Remove incldue stdio.h

2007-05-09	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, console/lpc22xx_uart.h: Remove warnings, cleanup and do
	not build SPARC code accidentally referenced in Makefile.am.

2007-05-09	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* console/uart.c, startup/bspclean.c, startup/bspstart.c: Remove debug
	print methods that are redundant with prntk and replace their usage
	with printk.

2007-05-01	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am: Tinkering to reduce .text size of minimum executable
	from ~64K to ~47K.
	* Renamed startup/exit.c to startup/bspclean.c 
	  * startup/bspclean.c: New file.
	  * startup/exit.c: Removed.

	* README, times, console/lpc22xx_uart.h, console/uart.c, include/bsp.h,
	start/start.S, startup/bspstart.c, startup/exit.c, startup/linkcmds:
	Update BSP to address changes between 4.7 and CVS head as well as to
	address comments from Ralf and Joel.

2007-04-26	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* Makefile.am: Remove reference to ../../shared/main.c.

2007-04-25	Ray Xu <xr@trasin.net>
