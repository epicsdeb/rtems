2008-12-08	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* bsp_specs: Backport from CVS-HEAD.

2008-09-29	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* Makefile.am: Remove noinst_PROGRAMS (Unused).

2008-08-21	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am: No BSP should use exit.c as a file name. exit() is POSIX
	routine.
	* startup/bspclean.c: New file.
	* startup/exit.c: Removed.

2008-08-18	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* smc/smc.c, startup/exit.c: Add missing prototypes.

2008-08-06      Chris Johns <chrisj@rtems.org>

	* smc/smc.c: Fix the fix. The field is bufnum.

2008-08-05	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* smc/smc.c: Fix warning.

2008-07-29	Chris Johns <chrisj@rtems.org>

	* smc/smc.c: Updated to the libblock changes.

2008-05-14	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am: Rework to avoid .rel files.

2008-05-12	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Refactored and renamed initialization routines to
	rtems_initialize_data_structures, rtems_initialize_before_drivers,
	rtems_initialize_device_drivers, and
	rtems_initialize_start_multitasking. This opened the sequence up so
	that bootcard() could provide a more robust and flexible framework
	which is easier to explain and understand. This also lays the
	groundwork for sharing the division of available memory between the
	RTEMS workspace and heap and the C library initialization across all
	BSPs.

2008-05-06	Ray Xu <rayx.cn@gmail.com>

	* console/uart.c, include/bsp.h, smc/smc.c, startup/bspstart.c: Merge
	smdk2410 with gp32.

2008-03-03	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/linkcmds: Add wildcard to gcc_except_table section so
	programs compiled with gcc 4.3.x can link.

2007-12-11	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h, startup/bspstart.c: Fix idle task prototype.

2007-12-11	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h, startup/bspstart.c: Eliminate copies of the
	Configuration Table. Use the RTEMS provided accessor macros to obtain
	configuration fields.

2007-12-04	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h, startup/bspstart.c: Move interrupt_stack_size field
	from CPU Table to Configuration Table. Eliminate CPU Table from all
	ports. Delete references to CPU Table in all forms.

2007-12-03	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, include/bsp.h, startup/bspstart.c: Moved most of the
	remaining CPU Table fields to the Configuration Table. This included
	pretasking_hook, predriver_hook, postdriver_hook, idle_task,
	do_zero_of_workspace, extra_mpci_receive_server_stack,
	stack_allocate_hook, and stack_free_hook. As a side-effect of this
	effort some multiprocessing code was made conditional and some style
	clean up occurred.

2007-09-12	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	PR 1257/bsps
	* startup/bspstart.c: Code outside of cpukit should use the public
	API for rtems_interrupt_disable/rtems_interrupt_enable. By bypassing
	the public API and directly accessing _CPU_ISR_Disable and
	_CPU_ISR_Enable, they were bypassing the compiler memory barrier
	directive which could lead to problems. This patch also changes the
	type of the variable passed into these routines and addresses minor
	style issues.

2007-05-28	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Eliminate maximum_drivers configuration parameter
2007-05-28	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Eliminate maximum_drivers configuration parameter
	since it was used to configure a no longer used feature. Device names
	are now part of the filesystem not in a table.

2007-05-15	Ray Xu <rayx@gmail.com>

	* Makefile.am: Add abort.rel since it is now in the BSP shared source,
	not in score/cpu.

2007-04-12	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* bsp_specs: Remove qrtems_debug.

2007-03-12	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* console/uart.c, start/start.S, startup/linkcmds, startup/memmap.c:
	Correct license URL and/or fix mistake in copyright notice. Both of
	these mistakes appear to be from code submitted after these changes
	were made previously.

2007-03-11	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Remove assignments of
	Cpu_table.do_zero_of_workspace to TRUE since TRUE is the default
	value in boot_card.c

2007-02-06	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* smc/smc.c: include bspIo.h for printk.

2006-12-15	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* smc/smc.c: Comment out sm_status (unused).

2006-11-15	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am: Merge c_rtems_main() into boot_card(). This eliminated a
	file and simplified initialization.

2006-10-17	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* Makefile.am: Remove superfluous -DASM.

2006-10-17	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* configure.ac: Require autoconf-2.60. Require automake-1.10.

2006-09-11	Chris Johns <chrisj@rtems.org>

	* smc/smc.h: Remove extra CRLF.
	
2006-01-11	Ralf Corsepius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* Makefile.am: Add preinstall.am.

2005-11-22	Ralf Corsepius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* Makefile.am: Remove lcd.rel, added console/uart.c,
	removed conio stuffs.
	* console/conio.c, console/console.c, console/defaultfont.c,
	include/conio.h : files removed.
	* console/uart.c: New file.
	* include/bsp.h: lcd.c prototypes removed.
	* startup/bspstart.c: bsp_reset() cause gp32 to reset to bios,
	added a bsp_idle_task which put s3c2400 in a "wait for IRQ" state.

2005-06-06	Philippe Simons <loki_666@fastmail.fm>

	* Makefile.am: Include lcd.rel.

2005-06-01	Philippe Simons <loki_666@fastmail.fm>

	* bsp_specs: Add rules for cpp support
	* include/bsp.h: Add gp32 support fct prototypes
	* console/conio.c: Moved video buffer to 0x0c7ed000
	* startup/bspstart.c: Add some init code, some cleaning...
