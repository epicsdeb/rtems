Notes
=====
This BSP has been modified to use the latest exception model.
The modifications were verified.

This BSP has been tested using DINK Rom monitor.  There have
been three rom chips loaded on the boards.  One with the SDS
debug monitor, one with the firmworks monitor, and one with
the DINK monitor.

The SCORE603e first generation board is no longer available,
does not appear to be in use by any RTEMS users, and thus
is no longer supported.
