2008-12-08	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* bsp_specs: Backport from CVS-HEAD.

2008-09-30	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* include/tm27.h: Do not use set_vector.

2008-09-24	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	PR 1322/bsps
	* include/bspopts.h.in: Remove.

2008-09-06	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Convert to "bool".

2008-08-20	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* console/consolelite.c, opbintctrl/opbintctrl.c:
	Add missing prototypes.

2008-07-22	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	* irq/irq_init.c, include/bsp.h:
	define BSP_PPC403_CLOCK_HOOK_EXCEPTION
	so that we hook the timer exception rather than going
	through the interrupt dispatcher.

2008-07-21	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Removed MSR_CE from interrupt
	mask - this was set for testing but should not be
	in the mask by default.

2008-07-21	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	* Makefile.am, preinstall.am, irq/irq_init.c:
	Use low-level exception handling support from
	new-exceptions/bspsupport.
	
2008-07-21	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Removed SPRG0 warning - this BSP
	is OK.

	Use interrupt stack limits from linker script.

	No need to reserve space beyond '_end'. linkcmds now
	reserves space below '_end'.

	Use low-level exception handling support from
	new-exceptions/bspsupport.

2008-07-21	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	* dlentry/dlentry.S: load R13 with _SDA_BASE_ so that
	SVR4-ABI access of short data area works. No support
	for R2/sdata2/eabi, so far but that would be easy
	(atm R2 is loaded with got address IIRC).

2008-07-21	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	* startup/linkcmds: fixed sdata/sbss areas -- these
	must be contiguous for SVR4 complicant access via R13.
	Use kludged layout so that sbss, bss, sbss2 are all
	contiguous and zeroed by dlentry.S.

	Provide _SDA_BASE_ and _SDA2_BASE_ for loading R13 (and
	R2 if anyone wants to use EABI).

	Make sure interrupt stack is never in heap area by
	moving it below '_end'. 

	Provide symbols for start + end of interrupt stack.

2008-07-21	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	* console/consolelite.c: use base address from RTEMS_XPARAMETERS_H
	rather than hardcoded hex number.

2008-05-15	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Add capability for bootcard.c BSP Initialization
	Framework to ask the BSP where it has memory for the RTEMS Workspace
	and C Program Heap. These collectively are referred to as work area.
	If the BSP supports this, then it does not have to include code to
	split the available memory between the two areas. This reduces the
	amount of code in the BSP specific bspstart.c file. Additionally, the
	shared framework can initialize the C Library, call
	rtems_debug_enable(), and dirty the work area memory. Until most/all
	BSPs support this new capability, if the BSP supports this, it should
	call RTEMS_BSP_BOOTCARD_HANDLES_RAM_ALLOCATION from its configure.ac.
	When the transition is complete, this autoconf macro can be removed.

2008-05-14	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am: Rework to avoid .rel files.

2008-05-12	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, startup/bspstart.c: Refactored and renamed
	initialization routines to rtems_initialize_data_structures,
	rtems_initialize_before_drivers, rtems_initialize_device_drivers, and
	rtems_initialize_start_multitasking. This opened the sequence up so
	that bootcard() could provide a more robust and flexible framework
	which is easier to explain and understand. This also lays the
	groundwork for sharing the division of available memory between the
	RTEMS workspace and heap and the C library initialization across all
	BSPs.

2008-03-03	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/linkcmds: Add wildcard to gcc_except_table section so
	programs compiled with gcc 4.3.x can link.

2007-12-11	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* README, include/bsp.h, startup/bspstart.c: Eliminate copies of the
	Configuration Table. Use the RTEMS provided accessor macros to obtain
	configuration fields.

2007-12-10	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	* irq/irq_init.c:
	renamed ASM_BOOKE_PIT_VECTOR to ASM_BOOKE_DEC_VECTOR
	to be closer to 'official' nomenclature.

2007-12-04	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h, startup/bspstart.c: Move interrupt_stack_size field
	from CPU Table to Configuration Table. Eliminate CPU Table from all
	ports. Delete references to CPU Table in all forms.

2007-12-03	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Moved most of the remaining CPU Table fields to
	the Configuration Table. This included pretasking_hook,
	predriver_hook, postdriver_hook, idle_task, do_zero_of_workspace,
	extra_mpci_receive_server_stack, stack_allocate_hook, and
	stack_free_hook. As a side-effect of this effort some multiprocessing
	code was made conditional and some style clean up occurred.

2007-11-30	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	* startup/bspstart.c: removed bsp_exceptions_in_RAM

2007-11-30	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	* irq/irq.h, irq/irq_init.c: Removed the definition
	of ASM_IRQ_VECTOR_BASE; this symbol was only use to
	initialize the irqBase member of the rtems_irq_global_settings
	struct. However, irqBase is an rtems_irq_symbolic_name,
	so using BSP_LOWEST_OFFSET is more appropriate.

2007-11-28	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Now compiles and links.

2007-11-28	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Eliminate PowerPC specific elements from the CPU
	Table. They have been replaced with variables named bsp_XXX as
	needed.

2007-11-07	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* aclocal.m4: Removed. Is automatically generated by bootstrap.

2007-10-02	Jukka Pietarinen <jukka.pietarinen@mrf.fi>

	* startup/linkcmds: Move definition of _end so memory is not corrupted.

2007-09-12	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	PR 1257/bsps
	* irq/irq_init.c: Code outside of cpukit should use the public API for
	rtems_interrupt_disable/rtems_interrupt_enable. By bypassing the
	public API and directly accessing _CPU_ISR_Disable and
	_CPU_ISR_Enable, they were bypassing the compiler memory barrier
	directive which could lead to problems. This patch also changes the
	type of the variable passed into these routines and addresses minor
	style issues.

2007-09-11      Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, include/bsp.h: Do not include networking
	drivers if networking is disabled.

2007-09-10	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* network/xiltemac.c: Remove duplicate prototype.

2007-08-09	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>
	* network/xiltemac.c:
	applied patch from Robert Grimes to correctly set the link speed
	to 100MBit

2007-07-27	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* linkcmds: removed superfluous bss section

2007-07-27	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* autom4te.cache/, network.old/: Removed.

2007-07-10	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* startup/linkcmds.dl: Removed.

2007-07-05	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* include/bsp.h: Added bsp/vectors.h and bsp/irq.h to list of
	included headers.

2007-07-05	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* opbintctrl/opbintctrl.c: Removed obsolete code.

2007-07-05	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* .cvsignore: New file.
