2008-12-08	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* bsp_specs: Backport from CVS-HEAD.

2008-08-18	Allan Hessenflow <allanh@kallisti.com>

	* Makefile.am, console/console-io.c, startup/bspstart.c: Update to use
	shared libcpu version of code implemented as part of bf537Stamp
	effort.

2008-08-15	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h: Fix CVS Id.

2008-06-04	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, preinstall.am: Need cplb.h

2008-05-16	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* preinstall.am, console/console-io.c: Install cplb.h and use it.

2008-05-15	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Add capability for bootcard.c BSP Initialization
	Framework to ask the BSP where it has memory for the RTEMS Workspace
	and C Program Heap. These collectively are referred to as work area.
	If the BSP supports this, then it does not have to include code to
	split the available memory between the two areas. This reduces the
	amount of code in the BSP specific bspstart.c file. Additionally, the
	shared framework can initialize the C Library, call
	rtems_debug_enable(), and dirty the work area memory. Until most/all
	BSPs support this new capability, if the BSP supports this, it should
	call RTEMS_BSP_BOOTCARD_HANDLES_RAM_ALLOCATION from its configure.ac.
	When the transition is complete, this autoconf macro can be removed.

2008-05-14	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am: Rework to avoid .rel files.

2008-05-12	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Refactored and renamed initialization routines to
	rtems_initialize_data_structures, rtems_initialize_before_drivers,
	rtems_initialize_device_drivers, and
	rtems_initialize_start_multitasking. This opened the sequence up so
	that bootcard() could provide a more robust and flexible framework
	which is easier to explain and understand. This also lays the
	groundwork for sharing the division of available memory between the
	RTEMS workspace and heap and the C library initialization across all
	BSPs.

2008-03-03	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/linkcmds: Add wildcard to gcc_except_table section so
	programs compiled with gcc 4.3.x can link.

2008-02-15	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* preinstall.am: Add cplb.h

2007-12-11	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h, startup/bspstart.c: Eliminate copies of the
	Configuration Table. Use the RTEMS provided accessor macros to obtain
	configuration fields.

2007-12-04	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h, startup/bspstart.c: Move interrupt_stack_size field
	from CPU Table to Configuration Table. Eliminate CPU Table from all
	ports. Delete references to CPU Table in all forms.

2007-12-03	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, startup/bspstart.c: Moved most of the remaining CPU
	Table fields to the Configuration Table. This included
	pretasking_hook, predriver_hook, postdriver_hook, idle_task,
	do_zero_of_workspace, extra_mpci_receive_server_stack,
	stack_allocate_hook, and stack_free_hook. As a side-effect of this
	effort some multiprocessing code was made conditional and some style
	clean up occurred.

2007-09-24	Chris Johns <chrisj@rtems.org>

	* include/bsp.h: Do not use C++ comments.

2007-09-20	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* preinstall.am: Add cplb.h.
	* startup/bspstart.c: Add cast of constant.

2007-09-10	Alain Schaefer <alani@easc.ch>

	* preinstall.am, startup/bspstart.c, startup/linkcmds: Complete earlier
	patch.
	* include/cplb.h: New file.

2007-09-10	Alain Schaefer <alani@easc.ch>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Add a useful routine to program memory protection
	in bfin. It is not used but a user of ezKit533 can customize its bsp
	and use this function.

2007-05-24	Alain Schaefer <alani@easc.ch>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Fix a problem in the InitEBIU method.

2007-04-17	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h, startup/bspstart.c: Fix compile errors and address
	most warnings about constants being too large.

2007-04-12	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* bsp_specs: Remove qrtems_debug.

2007-03-11	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Remove assignments of
	Cpu_table.do_zero_of_workspace to TRUE since TRUE is the default
	value in boot_card.c

2006-12-02	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* configure.ac: New BUG-REPORT address.

2006-11-20  Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* include/coverhd.h: Remove (Use shared default template instead).

2006-11-15	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am: Merge c_rtems_main() into boot_card(). This eliminated a
	file and simplified initialization.

2006-11-11  Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* startup/linkcmds: Use___start_set_sysctl_set, ___stop_set_sysctl_set
	instead of __start_set_sysctl_set, __stop_set_sysctl_set
	(bfin uses '_' prefixed c-symbols.)

2006-11-10  Alain Schaefer <alani@easc.ch>

	* startup/linkcmds: Put .fini into sdram.
	Add __edata, __etext.

2006-10-26	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>
