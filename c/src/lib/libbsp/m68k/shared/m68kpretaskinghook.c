 *  Function:   bsp_pretasking_hook
 *  Created:    95/03/10
 *
 *  Description:
 *      BSP pretasking hook.  Called just before drivers are initialized.
 *      Used to setup libc and install any BSP extensions.
 *
 *  NOTES:
 *      Must not use libc (to do io) from here, since drivers are
 *      not yet initialized.
